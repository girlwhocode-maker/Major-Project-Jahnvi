                                        Electricity Bill Calculator
    
    Project Description

This C program is an Electricity Bill Calculator that helps users calculate the total electricity bill based on the units consumed and the type of connection (Domestic or Commercial). The user enters personal details such as name, customer ID, connection type, and units used. The bill is then calculated using slab-based tariff rates. Fixed charges and tax are added to the final amount, and a detailed bill is displayed to the user.

    Instructions

2.The user is asked to enter:

  i.Customer Name

  ii.Customer ID

  iii.Type of Connection

3.The user must then enter the total number of units consumed.

4.Based on the units and connection type, the program:

  i.Applies slab-wise rates

  ii.Adds fixed charges

  iii.Adds tax

5.After calculation, a well-formatted electricity bill is printed showing:

  i.Customer details

  ii.Connection type

  iii.Units used

  iv.Total amount payable

6.If units consumed exceed 500, a warning message encourages the user to save electricity.

7.The program ends with a thank-you message.
